    <strong>INTRODUCING THE RENEGADE EXECUTIVE/ASSOCIATE PASTOR COACHING NETWORK</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Renegade XP Network is a brand new coaching experience <em>(just $99 a month after the first month)</em> that Nelson and I have been praying about and planning for
    several
    years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The idea is to create an on-going, relationship-based coaching experience to invest in the most underserved and under-appreciated pastors in our churches - Executive, Associate and Staff Pastors (small groups, ministry, assimilation, youth, young adults, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
   And as an Executive, Associate or Staff Pastor - you have no doubt struggled to find opportunities to grow professionally and personally that are specific to your unique role in the church
  </p>
  <p>
   In the Renegade XP Network - I want to invest in your growth as a leader, pastor, husband/wife, parent. I want to help you find fulfillment in your current role as a 2nd chair leader by helping you develop as a pastor and leader - but also grow in your personal and family life as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>NO SENIOR PASTORS OR WORSHIP PASTORS ALLOWED </strong>
    <em>(just kidding...sort of)</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This Coaching Network is designed specifically to invest in you and focuses
    on the specific roles, pressures, experiences and opportunities of
    Executive,
    Associate and Staff Pastors.
  </p>
  <p>
    As staff pastors and second chair leaders who are NOT Senior or Worship
    Pastors - there are very few resources targeted specifically for our
    professional,
    person and spiritual growth. And that's the HEART behind this new coaching
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The heart of the network will be our <strong>Monthly Strategy & Briefing
    Call</strong> - but as you will see below - there is so much more included!
    <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>AND YOU'RE INVITED TO BE A FOUNDING MEMBER!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      The Mission of the Renegade XP Network is to help you develop as a
      leader, achieve personal growth, find ministry-life balance, grow your
      church
      and
      accomplish great things for God's Kingdom.
